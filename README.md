Hello, I'm Akifa!



ABOUT ME

I am seeking to achieve in pursuing a career in pediatric nursing, I aim to provide compassionate and specialized care to children and their families. My goal is to achieve a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and I plan on passing the NCLEX-RN  exam, so I can then become a registered nurse. After becoming a registered nurse, I will then specialize in pediatric nursing through additional training, certifications and experience working in pediatric settings. I plan on obtaining a master's degree in nursing. Furthermore, I plan to participate in  pediatric internships and volunteer opportunities to enhance my skills and knowledge. I will seek mentorship from experienced pediatric nurses and stay updated with the latest advancements in pediatric care to achieve my career aspirations. My goals are to excel in nursing through my journey, specifically, specializing as a pediatric nurse practitioner, and to understand key medical concepts. I also aspire to become proficient in coding, as this skill will enable me to contribute to innovative healthcare solutions and improve patient care through technology. Additionally, further along the line I would like to get my DPN. 

 I'm currently working on creating my own brand and website focused on makeup because I‚Äôve always been passionate about beauty and the art of creating makeup looks. Makeup has been more than a hobby for me, t‚Äôs a form of self-expression, creativity, and confidence. Through this brand, I‚Äôm excited to share my work, connect with others who love beauty, and eventually offer products, tips, or services that empower others to feel confident in their skin. This is just the beginning, and I can‚Äôt wait to grow and bring my vision to life.
